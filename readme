The COVID trajectories file is an r-script that will download the NYT COVID dataset from thieir GitHub page and state populations from Wikipedia. Adding some varibables to the 
NYT data set and cleaning some values up we use the cross correlation compare states infection numbers.  Using these correlation values as pairwise distances we make each state
into a vector of correlations and cluster them.  Plotting the clusters we can see there are some obvious similarities within clusters.  There is some degree of variation 
within each cluster since the correlation is used as the distance metric and not the value of infections per 10,000.
